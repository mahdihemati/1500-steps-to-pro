poem = """There is no door 
There is no way 
It is not night 
not the moon Neither day nor sun
We stand outside of time 
With a bitter taste in our pollens
No one speaks to anyone
Silence speaks in a thousand languages
We comment on our dead with a funny design
And we wait for our turn
Without any laughter...
   _ Ahmad Shamlou"""
